# Machine Learning

# To remember

ct = ColumnTransformer([('town', OneHotEncoder(), [0])], remainder = 'passthrough') //town is the name of the colum [0] is the index to which oneHot needs to be applied and passthrough means rest of the columns need to just passed

if the dataset is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and n_splits=3
means the dataset is divided into 3 equal folds which is Total elements/n_splits = 9/3 that is 3
In the first iteration, the first 3 elements are the test set, and the rest are the training set.
In the second iteration, the next 3 elements are the test set, and the rest are the training set.
In the third iteration, the last 3 elements are the test set, and the rest are the training set.


# KFold and StratifiedKFold
KFold is sufficient in case of balanced dataset
Stratified is useful for inbalanced dataset
Suppose you have a dataset with 10 samples, and their target labels are [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0].
Using KFold (with n_splits=2), one split could assign more 0s in the test set and fewer 1s, leading to an unbalanced test set.
StratifiedKFold ensures that the proportion of labels (e.g., 0s and 1s) in the training and test sets is approximately the same as in the original dataset.

#Cross Validation 
Here n_estimators is the number of decision trees whereas cv defines the number of folds . It uses stratified Kfold by default

plt.scatter(km.cluster_centers_[:,0],km.cluster_centers_[:,1],color='purple',marker='*',label='centroid')
Here 0 represents the first column which represents age feature and 1 represent income feature(select all this features)


#Elbow Plot
An elbow plot is a graphical tool used to determine the optimal number of clusters in clustering algorithms, particularly in K-means clustering.
The elbow plot plots:

X-axis: The number of clusters (k).
Y-axis: A metric that measures clustering performance, commonly the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) or inertia, which represents the total distance of points from their respective cluster centroids.

dataset.data[0].reshape(8,8)// reshapes 1D array into 2D array


# Deep Learning

### **Convolutional Layers (`Conv2D`)**:

- **Purpose**: Convolutional layers are responsible for feature extraction. They learn filters (kernels) that capture patterns such as edges, textures, or shapes
- - **First Layer**: The first convolutional layer (`Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')`) learns low-level features like edges and basic textures.
- **Second Layer**: The second layer (`Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu')`) learns more complex features built upon the first layerâ€™s output, such as shapes, curves, and textures.
- **Third Layer**: The third layer (`Conv2D(128, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu')`) learns even more abstract and complex patterns from the previous features, helping the model understand more intricate patterns.

**Max Pooling Layers (`MaxPooling2D`)**
After each convolutional layer, a **max pooling layer** is used to downsample the feature map. This reduces the dimensionality and helps retain the most important features learned by the convolutional layers


### **Fully Connected Layers (`Dense`)**:

- **Purpose**: After feature extraction through convolutional layers, the flattened output is passed through fully connected layers to make predictions.

ANN:

Forward Pass: Each layer in an ANN performs a linear combination of inputs followed by an activation function.
CNN:

Convolution Operation: In the convolutional layer, a filter or kernel slides over the input data (such as an image) and performs a convolution operation to detect patterns.
